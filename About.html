      <p>My name is Rania HAMDI I am from Tunisia, I live in Sousse. I had my bachelor's degree in computer science from ISSAT Sousse after that I chose to complete my engineering diploma at EPI. During my studies, I had many internships in popular software development companies such as Satoripop, Nouvelair, Devrows, Proxyme IT. I am a very active person, I have participated in many national and international organizations like Junior Entreprise, JCI, Tunivision and IEEE. I am an engineer but what makes me more special is that I am a woman who keeps sacrificing even on professional life, I never stop giving the hand to my colleagues to push them to finish their works on time by being the great example to them, I'm a motivated person who keeps giving energy from heart to heart, work In teams is my favorite because I have the capacity to lead the group without giving orders to nobody, and passing the information smoothly between the team members. Not only that but I feel respected by all of them . I consider my self as a calm and perseverant person I am always trying to not give up early and handle a difficult situation with ease. I also like to work in a team and try to make a good impression in front of my colleagues by coming up with good and original ideas.</p>
